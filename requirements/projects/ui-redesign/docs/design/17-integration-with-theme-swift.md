# Integration with Theme.swift


DesignSystem is **separate** from existing Theme.swift:

- **Theme.swift**: Legacy app-wide colors (retained for compatibility)
- **DesignSystem/**: New iOS 26 design tokens and patterns

The design system can reference Theme.swift colors but owns all layout tokens, glass effects, and component patterns for the redesign.
