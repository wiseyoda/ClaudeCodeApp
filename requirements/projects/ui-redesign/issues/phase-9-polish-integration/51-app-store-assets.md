# Issue 51: App Store Assets and Metadata

**Phase:** 9 (Polish & Integration)
**Priority:** Medium
**Status:** Not Started
**Depends On:** 27 (Settings Redesign), 26 (Chat View Redesign), 38 (Accessibility), 46 (Localization)

## Goal

Prepare App Store assets and metadata for submission.

## Scope

- In scope: screenshots for iPhone/iPad, app preview notes, keywords, and feature bullets.
- Out of scope: paid marketing creative or external landing pages.

## Non-goals

- No promotional campaigns beyond store assets.

## Dependencies

- Core UI redesign completion to capture final screenshots.
- Localization readiness for store metadata.

## Touch Set

- Files to create: `assets/app-store/` (screenshots and captions), `requirements/projects/ui-redesign/docs/workflows/app-store-assets.md`.
- Files to modify: `CHANGELOG.md` if release notes are referenced.

## Interface Definitions

- Screenshot set list per device (iPhone 17 Pro, iPad Pro).
- Required metadata fields per locale.

## Edge Cases

- Dark vs light appearance consistency.
- Localized screenshots for key locales.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Screenshot set complete for required devices.
- [ ] Metadata draft reviewed and aligned with feature set.
- [ ] Accessibility highlights included in store copy.

## Tests

- [ ] Manual App Store Connect checklist review.
