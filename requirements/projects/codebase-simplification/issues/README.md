# Codebase Simplification Issues

This folder contains the source-of-truth issue files for the Codebase Simplification project. Each issue is a standalone task derived from the roadmap.

## How to Use

- Review the dependency order in `DEPENDENCY-GRAPH.md`.
- Pick one issue at a time and follow its scope and verification steps.
- Mark status inside the issue file when work starts or completes.

## Creating New Issues

1. Copy the template: `../ISSUE-TEMPLATE.md`
2. Name the file: `{number}-{short-name}.md`
3. Fill in all sections before starting work

## Notes

- Issue files are intentionally self-contained.
- Do not list individual issues here; use folder listing or the dependency graph.
